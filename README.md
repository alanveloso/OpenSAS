### **Blockchain-Spectrum-Access**

This project implements a decentralized solution for managing and exchanging information in Spectrum Access Systems (SAS) using **blockchain** technology. It replaces the traditional SAS-SAS interface with a **smart contract-based** approach to ensure secure, auditable, and transparent communication between different SAS instances.

#### **Key Features:**

* **CBSD (Citizen Broadband Radio Service Devices) Management**: Registers, updates, and queries information about CBSDs, including grant amounts and statuses.
* **Spectrum Coordination**: Manages protected zones and spectrum grants, ensuring proper coordination and sharing of spectrum resources.
* **Event Logging**: Logs events related to spectrum management and coordination, providing an immutable and auditable trail of all actions.
* **Smart Contracts**: Automates processes like data sharing agreements, grant allocation, and status updates through smart contracts on a permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Besu).
* **Transparency and Security**: All interactions between SAS instances are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

This project aims to enhance the management of spectrum resources for emerging mobile networks, particularly for **5G/6G** technologies.
